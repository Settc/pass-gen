# Password Generator


## Introduction
   I have made a password generator that asks the user for their desired criteria that will make up the password. The criteria includes upper case, lower case, numbers, special characters, and the length of the password. After selecting the criteria, the password will be delivered to the user through an alert.

### Technologies
Project uses the following languages/frameworks:

#### Contributing
All javascript done by me, Thomas Whittle.

##### Known issues
If user chooses no critera the first time, and then does choose the second time, the password
generates twice at the end.
